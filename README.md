# ZalpeKomputer E-commerce

## 📦 About

**ZalpeKomputer** is a simple e-commerce website project built **purely for learning purposes** by a junior programmer. It’s designed to simulate an online store selling computer equipment and peripherals, especially for gaming needs. This project combines **React JS** for the front-end, **Bootstrap 5.2** for styling, and **PHP Native API** for the back-end. It is still under development and not intended for commercial use.
